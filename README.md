#### Hosting a Distributed Land-Records Ledger on Cloud
 
## Abstract:  
In India, there are many instances of Land related disputes. The reasons usually are the manipulation of local records by the usage of money. However if the records are hosted on a distributed ledger(for e.g. blockchain), No one will be able to manipulate the records. This will drastically make it easier for the courts to resolve the land disputes.
